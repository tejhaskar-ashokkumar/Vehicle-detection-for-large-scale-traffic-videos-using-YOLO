# Vehicle-detection-for-large-scale-traffic-videos-using-YOLO

The system takes the video of an highway as an input and counts the number of vehicles entering the highway using YOLO.

Get the pre-trained YOLO model and weights from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ or git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
The config file and coco.names files are present in cfg folder and data folder respectively.

Download the YOLO weights from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights or using wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights from cmd.

Finally, run vehicle_detection.py
